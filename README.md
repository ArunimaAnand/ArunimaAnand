# 🎀 **Hi, I'm Arunima Anand!**

### **Data Science Graduate Student at UC San Diego 👩🏻‍🎓 | Former Consultant at Deloitte 👩🏻‍💻 | Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, Applied AI 💡**

I build machine learning systems that blend statistical reasoning, algorithmic precision, and scalable engineering. My work spans forecasting architectures, feature-weighted scoring systems, retrieval-augmented pipelines, embeddings-driven search, and enterprise-grade applied ML. At Deloitte, I spent three years designing end-to-end intelligence systems, experimenting with LLM-based automation, and applying RLHF-inspired evaluation loops to enhance AI-assisted workflows and human-in-the-loop decision processes.

Currently at UC San Diego, I am deepening my understanding of machine learning theory, algorithmic foundations, statistical modeling, and modern AI while exploring how creativity and analytical clarity complement each other.

I have studied patterns for as long as I can remember. Growing up as a dancer helped me appreciate rhythm and structure, and that instinct naturally evolved into how I think about sequences, temporal behavior, and data dynamics today. I enjoy exploring how small variations influence large systems, whether in choreography or in statistical models.
